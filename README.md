## Architecture

![MVVM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30031f29-08b6-4002-a487-28c12ba6f830)

The application follows the **MVVM+Protocol** architecture pattern:

### ðŸ“¦ Model
- Defines the data structures, including news articles and app settings.
- Contains no business logic â€” purely represents data.

### ðŸŽ› ViewModel (Business Logic)
- Acts as an intermediary between View and Model.
- Uses protocols to communicate with View and decouple dependencies.
- Handles data fetching, transformation, and state management.
- Implements core features like searching and settings updates.

### ðŸ–¥ View (UI)
- Built using **UIKit**, supporting **programmatic UI**.
- Uses `UITableView` for displaying articles.
- Observes the ViewModel for state changes via delegation.
- Sends user actions to ViewModel through protocols.

This pattern ensures a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
